# Blender MVR/GDTF Addon

This directory contains the starting point for a Blender addon that aims to add support
for MVR (My Virtual Rig) and GDTF (General Device Type Format) files. The addon will
allow Blender to import lighting setups and fixture definitions described in these
formats.

This repository currently provides only a minimal skeleton. Future work will include
implementing operators for loading data, custom properties for fixtures, and integration
with Blender's lighting system.
